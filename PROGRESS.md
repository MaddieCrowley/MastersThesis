# Simple Progress tracking!

## Done!
* Read papers and conducted literature review on prior work in subject matter
* Started Git project, started Verilog codebase, fought with Matlab (now works), and came up with potential filter architecture

## Todo!
* Rewrite DDS algo from Tiny Tapeout
* Rewrite modulation from TT
* Finish filter SV code
* Simulink testing of filter model and code 
* Verify functionality 
* Write lit review
* Start writing thesis 
* Test on FPGA board w/ DAC
* Verify overall functionality
* Submit design to tapeout
* Verify TT chip
* Write up testing
* Profit? (Graduate!)
